## Threat Modeling

A threat model is a structured process for identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing potential threats and vulnerabilities to a system, application, or organization, followed by defining mitigation strategies to address those threats. The goal of threat modeling is to help stakeholders understand what assets are most at risk, the likely attacker profiles, relevant attack vectors, and what controls or defenses should be included, based on potential security risks.

-> Basically it is the process of identifying the threat, analyzing the threat, and then preparing a plan to mitigate the most potential threats one by one based on priority.

### Key Components

- Description of the system or subject being modeled.
- Assumptions about the environment and its future changes.
- Identification and enumeration of potential threats.
- Proposed mitigation actions for each threat.
- Validation and verification steps to ensure defenses are effective.

-> This model directly maps to the SOC operations in information security.

### Applications

Threat modeling can be applied to:
- Software and applications
- Systems and networks
- IoT devices and distributed systems
- Business processes

### Purpose

The main purpose is to identify and address security risks early, often during the design phase of development, allowing organizations to proactively secure systems before deployment.

### Example Methods

Common approaches include creating attacker personas, mapping data flows, and prioritizing issues by severity, helping organizations allocate resources to the most critical threats first.

Threat modeling is a foundational activity in cybersecurity and risk management, ensuring that systems are designed and maintained with security in mind from the outset.
