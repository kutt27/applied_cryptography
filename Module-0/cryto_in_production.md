“Cryptography in production” refers to the real-world use of cryptographic methods and tools within operational systems, software, and environments to protect sensitive data, validate identities, and secure communications against threats. This means moving beyond academic or theoretical concepts and actually implementing encryption, digital signatures, hashing, and related techniques in live environments where data is generated, processed, stored, and accessed by users and applications.

### Key Aspects

- **Confidentiality**: Encryption transforms readable data into ciphertext, making it inaccessible to unauthorized users in transit and at rest.
- **Integrity**: Hash functions and digital signatures ensure that data remains unaltered from its source to destination.
- **Authentication**: Use of cryptographic techniques like PKI and digital certificates confirms the identity of systems, users, and devices.
- **Non-repudiation**: Cryptography provides proof that a specific actor performed an action or transaction, preventing denial of involvement.

### Production Considerations

- In production, cryptography must be robust, scalable, and properly managed - particularly the generation, distribution, and rotation of keys.
- Systems use cryptography in practical contexts, such as securing APIs, email, files, databases, and payment systems, ensuring compliance with standards and regulations like GDPR and PCI-DSS.

In summary, running cryptography “in production” means using tested, reliable cryptographic algorithms and protocols to safeguard live, operational systems and data from modern cyber threats.

Cryptography is an essential tool within the broader field of cybersecurity, but relying solely on it does not guarantee complete security. Cryptography can secure data—by providing confidentiality, integrity, and authentication—yet it does not address threats such as malware, phishing, misconfigurations, poor access controls, insider threats, or human error.[4][5]

### Cryptography: A Tool, Not a Solution

- Cryptography functions as a set of mathematical techniques for encrypting and verifying data, making it unreadable to unauthorized parties.
- It can protect information in transit and at rest, verify identities, and ensure data integrity, but these capabilities must be integrated with other security controls for robust protection.
- ==Without layered defenses such as secure architecture, access management, monitoring, and incident response,== systems remain vulnerable, even if cryptography is implemented.

In effect, cryptography should be seen as a vital component—one “line of defense”—within a multi-layered security strategy, not as a standalone solution to all security challenges.
